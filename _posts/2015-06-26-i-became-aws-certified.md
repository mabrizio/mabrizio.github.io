I took the the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate][aws_csa_a] exam on
June 24, 2015. It was harder than I thought but I passed the exam without any hassle,
besides my experience working with the AWS cloud ecosystem I invested a good amount
of hours preparing myself for the test.

This is what I did:

* I took [Ryan Kroonenburg][ryankroonenburg]'s [course on Udemy][AWSCSAA2015]. It's
just $69 (very cheap, and highly recomended).
* I spent a lot of time watching videos on [their channel on YouTube][yt_aws].
* I read almost every FAQ available for all of their services, for example:
    * [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud][ec2_faq]
    * [Simple Storage Service][s3_faq]
    * [Amazon CloudFront][cf_faq]
    * [Route53][r53_faq]
    * [Amazon Relational Database Service][rds_faq]
    * etc.


Probably, it's not necessary to do everything I did to pass the exam, but it worked
for me.

[Mohammed Ilyas][mohamed_ilyas] has prepared a great youtube playlist with a lot of
information that can be useful too, you can [enjoy it here][mohamed_playlist].

Well guys, they now allow me to use their logo on my page, so this is it:
